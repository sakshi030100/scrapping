</div> id="id6336ecc31b428"  tabindex="" title="View Answer"    >View Answer</span><div id="target-id6336ecc31b428" class="collapseomatic_content ">Answer: b
Explanation: A relation in a set A is said to be symmetric if (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R implies that (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R,for every a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>&isin;R.
Hence, for the given set A={1, 2, 3}, R={(1, 2), (2, 1)} is symmetric. It is not reflexive since every element is not related to itself and neither transitive as it does not satisfy the condition that for a given relation R in a set A if (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R and (a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>)&isin;R implies that (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>)&isin; R for every a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>&isin;R.

<p>7. Let I be a set of all lines in a XY plane and R be a relation in I defined as R = {(I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>):I<sub>1</sub> is parallel to I<sub>2</sub>}. What is the type of given relation?
</p><div class="op1"> Reflexive relation
</div><div class="op2">b) Transitive relation
</div><div class="op3">c) Symmetric relation
</div><div class="op4">d) Equivalence relation
</div> id="id6336ecc31b458"  tabindex="" title="View Answer"    >View Answer</span><div id="target-id6336ecc31b458" class="collapseomatic_content ">Answer: d
Explanation: This is an equivalence relation. A relation R is said to be an equivalence relation when it is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.
Reflexive: We know that a line is always parallel to itself. This implies that I<sub>1</sub> is parallel to I<sub>1</sub> i.e. (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R. Hence, it is a reflexive relation.
Symmetric: Now if a line I<sub>1</sub> || I<sub>2</sub> then the line I<sub>2</sub> || I<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R implies that (I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>)&isin;R. Hence, it is a symmetric relation.
Transitive: If two lines (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>) are parallel to a third line (I<sub>2</sub>) then they will be parallel to each other i.e. if (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>) &isin;R and (I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>) &isin;R implies that (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>) &isin;R.

</div> id="id6336ecc31b463"  tabindex="" title="View Answer"    >View Answer</span><div id="target-id6336ecc31b463" class="collapseomatic_content ">Answer: d
Explanation: R= {(4, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4)} is symmetric since (4, 5) and (5, 4) are converse of each other thus satisfying the condition for a symmetric relation and it is transitive as (4, 5)&isin;R and (5, 4)&isin;R implies that (4, 4) &isin;R. It is not reflexive as every element in the set I is not related to itself.
