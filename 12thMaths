Explanation: A relation in a set A is said to be symmetric if (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R implies that (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R,for every a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>&isin;R.<br />
Hence, for the given set A={1, 2, 3}, R={(1, 2), (2, 1)} is symmetric. It is not reflexive since every element is not related to itself and neither transitive as it does not satisfy the condition that for a given relation R in a set A if (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R and (a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>)&isin;R implies that (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>)&isin; R for every a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>&isin;R.<br />

Explanation: For the above given set S = {3, 4, 6}, R = {(3, 4), (4, 6), (3, 6)} is transitive as (3,4)&isin;R and (4,6) &isin;R and (3,6) also belongs to R . It is not a reflexive relation as it does not satisfy the condition (a,a)&isin;R, for every a&isin;A for a relation R in the set A.<br />

Explanation: The relation R= {(7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9)} is reflexive as every element is related to itself i.e. (a,a) &isin; R, for every a&isin;A. and it is not transitive as it does not satisfy the condition that for a relation R in a set A if (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R and (a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>)&isin;R implies that (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>) &isin; R for every a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub> &isin; R.<br />

<p>7. Let I be a set of all lines in a XY plane and R be a relation in I defined as R = {(I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>):I<sub>1</sub> is parallel to I<sub>2</sub>}. What is the type of given relation?<br />
a) Reflexive relation<br />
b) Transitive relation<br />
c) Symmetric relation<br />
d) Equivalence relation<br />
<span class="collapseomatic " id="id6336ecc31b458"  tabindex="" title="View Answer"    >View Answer</span><div id="target-id6336ecc31b458" class="collapseomatic_content ">Answer: d<br />
Explanation: This is an equivalence relation. A relation R is said to be an equivalence relation when it is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.<br />
Reflexive: We know that a line is always parallel to itself. This implies that I<sub>1</sub> is parallel to I<sub>1</sub> i.e. (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R. Hence, it is a reflexive relation.<br />
Symmetric: Now if a line I<sub>1</sub> || I<sub>2</sub> then the line I<sub>2</sub> || I<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>)&isin;R implies that (I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>1</sub>)&isin;R. Hence, it is a symmetric relation.<br />
Transitive: If two lines (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>) are parallel to a third line (I<sub>2</sub>) then they will be parallel to each other i.e. if (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>) &isin;R and (I<sub>2</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>) &isin;R implies that (I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>3</sub>) &isin;R.<br />

<p>8. Which of the following relations is symmetric and transitive but not reflexive for the set I = {4, 5}?<br />

b) R = {(4, 4), (5, 5)}<br />
c) R = {(4, 5), (5, 4)}<br />

Explanation: R= {(4, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4)} is symmetric since (4, 5) and (5, 4) are converse of each other thus satisfying the condition for a symmetric relation and it is transitive as (4, 5)&isin;R and (5, 4)&isin;R implies that (4, 4) &isin;R. It is not reflexive as every element in the set I is not related to itself.<br />

<p>10. (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>) &isin;R implies that (a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>) &isin; R, for all a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>&isin;A. This condition is for which of the following relations?<br />
a) Equivalence relation<br />
b) Reflexive relation<br />
c) Symmetric relation<br />
d) Universal relation<br />
<span class="collapseomatic " id="id6336ecc31b477"  tabindex="" title="View Answer"    >View Answer</span><div id="target-id6336ecc31b477" class="collapseomatic_content ">Answer: c<br />
Explanation: The above is a condition for a symmetric relation.<br />
For example, a relation R on set A = {1,2,3,4} is given by R={(a,b):a+b=3, a&gt;0, b&gt;0}<br />
1+2 = 3, 1&gt;0 and 2&gt;0 which implies (1,2) &isin; R.<br />
Similarly, 2+1 = 3, 2&gt;0 and 1&gt;0 which implies (2,1)&isin;R. Therefore both (1, 2) and (2, 1) are converse of each other and is a part of the relation. Hence, they are symmetric.<br />
